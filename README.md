### Project Description
This JavaScript code implements the classic FizzBuzz problem. The FizzBuzz problem involves printing numbers from 1 to a specified range (in this case, 100). However, for multiples of 3, the code prints "Fizz", for multiples of 5, it prints "Buzz", and for numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, it prints "FizzBuzz". The code utilizes a function called FizzBuzz(n) where n represents the upper limit of the range. It iterates through numbers from 1 to n, checking each number's divisibility by 3, 5, or both, and appending the corresponding string or number to an array. Finally, it returns the array containing the FizzBuzz sequence. The result is then logged to the console using ```console.log(FizzBuzz(100));```.
