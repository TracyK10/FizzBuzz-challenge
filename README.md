### Project Description
This JavaScript code implements the classic FizzBuzz problem. The FizzBuzz problem involves printing numbers from 1 to a specified range (in this case, 100). However, for multiples of 3, the code prints "Fizz", for multiples of 5, it prints "Buzz", and for numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, it prints "FizzBuzz". The code utilizes a function called FizzBuzz(n) where n represents the upper limit of the range. It iterates through numbers from 1 to n, checking each number's divisibility by 3, 5, or both, and appending the corresponding string or number to an array. Finally, it returns the array containing the FizzBuzz sequence. 
### Usage
To use the FizzBuzz function, simply call it with an integer argument representing the upper limit of the range (e.g., FizzBuzz(100) to print numbers from 1 to 100).

```console.log(FizzBuzz(100))```;
